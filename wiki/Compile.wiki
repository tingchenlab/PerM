#labels Phase-Deploy
Precompiled executables are available for several platforms in the download section.

PerM has been compiled in Red Hat (32 bit and 64 bit) and Windows XP (32 bit), Windows 7 (64 bit), with gcc 3.0, gcc 4.3 and Visual C++. It has also been compiled on Mac Darwin kernel 9.8, but hasn't been tried with OpenMP. Please email "yanghoch at usc.edu", if you encounter any problems or have any suggestions.

To unzip the source code that you download on Linux, type {{{unzip ./Source_Code_PerM_0.2.0.zip}}} in the directory with the download. For gcc under Linux, type *make* in the unzip directory to generate the execute file PerM. Note, the attached makefile is for Linux with gcc 4.3 or later. Type gcc -v to check your compiler version. Because OpenMP is only supported since gcc 4.3, you must remove the *-fopenmp* flag from the CFLAGS definition on the first line of the makefile to compile with an earlier version of gcc. However, this is not recommended if your computer has a multiple CPUs/cores because without OpenMP only a single CPU/core will be utilized. 

For Windows users, it is easy to add the source code to Eclipse or Visual C++ projects and compile. For VC++ 2008, it is normal to have many security warnings.
