====./PerM Ref.fasta Reads.fasta -v 5 -o out.mapping ====
With the above command, PerM maps reads in {{{reads.fa}}} to the reference sequences in {{{Ref.fasta}}}, allowing five mismatches. However, the default [http://code.google.com/p/perm/wiki/Algorithms seed] chosen according to the read length, is only full sensitive to two or three mismatches. PerM first checks if the index had been saved in the default path. If yes, use it; if no, build it. It won't save the index in disk, unless flag {{{-s}}} is specified. It outputs to the file {{{out.mapping}}} in the [http://code.google.com/p/perm/wiki/Output mapping] format. 

====./PerM hg18.txt Reads.txt -v 5 -E -u Missed.fa ====
The {{{hg18.txt}}} should be file listing each reference fasta file in a line.
The {{{Reads.txt}}} should be the file listing each reads set in a line. 
[http://code.google.com/p/perm/wiki/Input more]. With flag {{{-E}}}, PerM will exclude the ambiguous mapping and output only the unique mapping, in term of number of mismatches. 
It allows five mismatches and output the unmapped reads to file {{{Missed.fa}}}
