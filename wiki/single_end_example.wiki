====./PerM Ref.fasta Reads.fasta -v 5 -o out.mapping ====
With the above command line, PerM maps reads.fa to Ref.fasta, allowing five mismatches and output to out.mapping in the [http://code.google.com/p/perm/wiki/Output mapping] format. It will check if the index has been saved in the default path. If yes, use the index; if no, build the index, but won't save it in the default path. The seed is chosen by PerM, according to the read length.

====./PerM hg18.txt Reads.txt -v 5 -E -u Missed.fa ====
The {{{hg18.txt}}} should be file listing each reference fasta file in a line.
The {{{Reads.txt}}} should be the file listing each reads set in a line. 
[http://code.google.com/p/perm/wiki/Input more]. With flag {{{-E}}}, PerM will exclude the ambiguous mapping and output only the unique mapping, in term of number of mismatches. 
It allows five mismatches and output the unmapped reads to file {{{Missed.fa}}}
