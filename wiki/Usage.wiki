= Introduction =
PerM uses both configure file and command line options, which is simple for testing. We are still working hard to standardize I/O and options with other mapper, especially Applied Biosystems pipeline.

= The command line options =
The currently command line option requires input in order. It needs 
  * A reference in .fasta file or a .txt which has many fasta file names, each in a row. 
  * The reads file in .fasta, .prb or .csfasta formats or a .txt file as the list of those files.
  * The full sensitivity threshold.
== Reference ==

== Reads file ==
PerM expects reads are all from SOLiD or all from Solexa sequencer. If the first read file has the extend name ".csfasta", PerM expects all reads are from SOLiD. PerM expects 
all reads have the same length, which is detected using the first read in the first read file by PerM.
== Full sensitivity threshold ==


 That
The type of the reads (SOLiD or Solexa) are decided

Note PerM will get the read length use the first reads file to 


, which can be 2, 3, 4 mismatches or the special threshold for SOLiD, ex: "one color + one base", which 


Given no command line option, PerM will try to open a default configure file name "config.pref". Given only one command line option, it should be the name of the configure file. The configure file format is described in the next section.
