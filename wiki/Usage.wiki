= Introduction =
PerM uses both configure file and command line options, which is simple for testing. We are still working hard to standardize I/O and options with other mapper, especially Applied Biosystems pipeline.

= The command line options =
The currently command line option requires input in order. It needs 
  * A reference in .fasta file or a .txt which has many fasta file names, each in a row. 
  * The reads file in .fasta, .prb or .csfasta formats or a .txt file as the list of those files.
  * The full sensitivity threshold.
== Reference ==
== Reads file ==
== Full sensitivity threshold ==


Note PerM use the extend file name of the first read file to decide it is mapping a SOLiD reads or Solexa reads. That
The type of the reads (SOLiD or Solexa) are decided

Note PerM will get the read length use the first reads file to 


, which can be 2, 3, 4 mismatches or the special threshold for SOLiD, ex: "one color + one base", which 


Given no command line option, PerM will try to open a default configure file name "config.pref". Given only one command line option, it should be the name of the configure file. The configure file format is described in the next section.
