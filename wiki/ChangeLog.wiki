#summary Changes to the ComB software package.

== Changes in command line arguments. ==

 * The argument order to {{{mapcand}}} has changed to be consistent with the rest of the comb commands.  Now give the reference, followed by the file produced by {{{mapcount}}}.
  {{{comb mapcount reference.fa reads.map_cnt}}}

 * The arguments to {{{snpcall}}} have changed.  The callrates file is now optional.  If given it is passed in with {{{-r/--call-rates}}}.

== Changes in command line options == 

 * There is a new option to {{{view}}} and {{{easyrun}}} for hiding SNPs which were called back to the reference base.  {{{--hide-unchanged}}} will not output these SNPs in the text view.
