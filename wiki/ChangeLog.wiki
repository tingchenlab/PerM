== PerM Changelog == 

*Version 0.3.2.0*

 * Changed definition of *-k* parameter to mean alignments will not be output if there are more than # alignments rather than # or more alignments. The current definition is the same as the meaning of the *-k* switch in Bowtie. To convert from using an older version of PerM, change -k # to -k #-1, e.g. *-k 5* to *-k 4*.

 * Fixed a segmentation fault that occurred when *-k 1* or *-k 2* was used with the *-a* switch.

 * The default read file names 'F3' and 'R3; are changed to 'F'; and 'R', meaning forward and reverse, in order to avoid confusion of with seed F3. 

*Version 0.3.1.0*

 * Fixed bug introduced in PerM 0.3.0.0 where reference sequence was not reverse complemented in .mapping output if read file was in FASTA format.

*Version 0.2.9.9*

 * Alignments for reads mapped to more positions than the threshold set by the *-k* switch (default 200) are no longer included in the mapping output. The new *-a* _filename_ option can be used to collect such reads. Previously, the first 200 (or *-k* specified) alignments were output to the mapping file.

 * Fixed issue with reads longer than 64 bp. Last base was ignored for reads with an odd number of bases.

*Version 0.2.9.7*

 * 6 mismatches limit for SOLID reads removed.
