== PerM Changelog == 

*Version 0.3.1.0*

 * Fixed bug introduced in PerM 0.3.0.0 where reference sequence was not reverse complemented in .mapping output if read file was in FASTA format.

*Version 0.2.9.9*

 * Alignments for reads mapped to more positions than the threshold set by the *-k* switch (default 200) are no longer included in the mapping output. The new *-a* _filename_ option can be used to collect such reads. Previously, the first 200 (or *-k* specified) alignments were output to the mapping file.

 * Fixed issue with reads longer than 64 bp. Last base was ignored for reads with an odd number of bases.

*Version 0.2.9.7*

 * 6 mismatches limit for SOLID reads removed.
