#labels samTools
You can use samtools to to pileup and get consensus sequence. 
To get the expression level of RNA-seq from sam file, I wrote a simple bash shell wrapper [http://perm.googlecode.com/files/pileUp.sh wrapper] to combine multiple steps into one command. After you get the wig file with signal for each base-pair, you can further condense it to bed with my python scripts [http://perm.googlecode.com/files/Wig2Bed.py wig2Bed.py]. The output can be be showed on the genome browsers as the example [http://dw408k-1.cmb.usc.edu:8080/GeneList.htm web pages] on my computer, after proper headers line are added.
