#labels samTools
Samtools provides functions to pileup and get consensus sequence. 
To get the expression level of RNA-seq from sam file, I wrote a simple bash shell wrapper to combine multiple steps into one command. 


You can use my python script (wig2Bed.py)to further condense the wiggle file into bed.
The output example can be further process to be showed on the genome browsers as the [http://dw408k-1.cmb.usc.edu:8080/GeneList.htm web page] on my computer.
