iPerM is a wrapper around PerM which maps reads chromosome by chromosome. 
It sorts and combines the mapping results at the end. This means the maximum memory usage is bounded by the size of the largest chromosome. For a human reference, the memory usage will not exceed roughly 245 M bases @ 4.5 bytes / base = 1.1 GB, where 245 M is the Chr1 length. Thus PerM will run comfortably on a 2 GB machine even with the OS overhead.
