Users can use the RepeatFinding.sh scripts to identify repeats.
To use the shell, the two programs PerM and Sim_Solexa must be in your path.

== Input ==
 * Transcriptom in fasta format
 * Reference file in fasta, index or a txt which is a list of fa file
 * read lengths
 * number of mismatches
 * Y/N Y if the reference is transcriptom. N if the reference is genome

== Meta file names== 
 * Index file 
 * Simulated reads 
 * Simulated reads list
 * mapping log file

== Output ==
 === transcriptom to transcriptom ===
 === transcriptom to genome ===

== Limitations == 
 The meta file's path is currently hard coded. Which means running both command "Y" and "N" will overwrite each others meta file. To avoid that, the two run should be in two different directly with a link to the parameter 1 and 2 in the current dirrectly.
