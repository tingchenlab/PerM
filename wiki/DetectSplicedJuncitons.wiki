To detect the occurrences of splicing events from RNA-seq data, you can download the
[http://genes.mit.edu/burgelab/mRNA-Seq known human alternative sliced junctions seq] from Dr.Burge's lab at MIT. These human junctions sequences are 50 bases, 25 in each exon side. 
Map the junctions sequence as read to the initially unmapped reads in fasta (bases)format.
You can use {{{-t}}} and {{{-T}}} options to cut the 5' or 3' end of the sequences to increase the sensitivity. However, further check may be ensure the junctions are not mapped by accident. 

PerM has speed advantage compared to BWT methods in the above progress because it can build index for 3 billion bp ref in half hour with 16 CPUs. Note the reference is long reads in bases. You need to split the read set if it is larger than 4 billion bases, due to the integer index size in C++ is limiated.
