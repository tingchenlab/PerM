The data downloaded from the short read archive is in ACGT instead of the color signals.
We did the color translation and provide the used proportion in our download section.

The data set is too large for many people to download.   
  * Real SOLiD reads from B anthracis. can be downloaded from SOCS's page [http://socs.biology.gatech.edu/Download.html]. 
  * Simulated SOLiD or Solexa reads can be generated using the small program in the download section.
